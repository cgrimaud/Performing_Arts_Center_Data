# Performing Arts Center Data

### This SQL project creates tables, inserts data, and performs queries for a fictitious Performing Arts Center. 

There are 6 tables:
  1. Patrons
  2. Theaters
  3. EventCategories
  4. TheatricalEvents
  5. Orders
  6. OrderItems
  
I used https://www.mockaroo.com/ for the Patrons data.
